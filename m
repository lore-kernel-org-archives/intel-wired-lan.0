Subject: [Intel-wired-lan] [PATCH v3 11/16] docs: networking:
 device_drivers: replace some characters
In-Reply-To: <cover.1621159997.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org>
References: <cover.1621159997.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org>

List-ID: <intel-wired-lan.osuosl.org>

The conversion tools used during DocBook/LaTeX/html/Markdown->ReST
conversion and some cut-and-pasted text contain some characters that
aren't easily reachable on standard keyboards and/or could cause
troubles when parsed by the documentation build system.

Replace the occurences of the following characters:

	- U+00a0 ('?'): NO-BREAK SPACE
	  as it can cause lines being truncated on PDF output
