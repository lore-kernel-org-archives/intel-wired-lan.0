The maintainer is not necessarily the owner/author of the code, and
thus may not know the intent of the code.

BTW, you cannot mindlessly fix the latter, as you cannot know if
"(a == b)" or "((a = b))" was intended, without understanding the code
(and the (possibly unavailable) data sheet, and the hardware, ...).

P.S. So far I've stayed out of this thread, as I like it if the compiler
     flags possible mistakes.  After all I was the one fixing new
     "may be used uninitialized" warnings thrown up by gcc-4.1, until
     (a bit later than) support for that compiler was removed...
