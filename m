[resending as v2, vim session got broken while editing patch]

Hi,

here are two small fixes around XDP support in ice driver.

Jamal reported that ice driver does not support XDP on his side. This
got me really puzzling and I had no clue what was going on. Turned that
this is the case when device is in 'safe mode', so let's add a dedicated
ndo_bpf for safe mode ops and make it clear to user what needs to be
fixed. I've described that in the commit message of patch 1 more
thoroughly.

Second issue was found during implementing XDP Tx fallback path for
unsufficient queue count case, which I will send on next week once I'm
back from woods. Hopefully.

Thanks!

  ice: add ndo_bpf callback for safe mode netdev ops
  ice: parametrize functions responsible for Tx ring management
