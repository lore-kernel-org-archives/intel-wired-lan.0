On a VIPT/VIVT architecture, this is horrendously wasteful.  You're
taking something that was mapped at colour c_src mapping it to a new
address src_kaddr, which is likely a different colour and necessitates
flushing the original c_src, then you copy it to dst_kaddr, which is
also likely a different colour from c_dst, so dst_kaddr has to be
flushed on kunmap and c_dst has to be invalidated on kmap.  What we
should have is an architectural primitive for doing this, something
like kmemcopy_arch(dst, src).  PIPT architectures can implement it as
the above (possibly losing kmap if they don't need it) but VIPT/VIVT
architectures can set up a correctly coloured mapping so they can
simply copy from c_src to c_dst without any need to flush and the data
arrives cache hot at c_dst.
