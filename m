Currently when XDP rings are created, each descriptor gets its DD bit
set, which turns out to be the wrong approach as it can lead to a
situation where more descriptors get cleaned than it was supposed to,
e.g. when AF_XDP busy poll is run with a large batch size. In this
situation, the driver would request for more buffers than it is able to
handle.

Fix this by not setting the DD bits in ice_xdp_alloc_setup_rings(). They
should be initialized to zero instead.
