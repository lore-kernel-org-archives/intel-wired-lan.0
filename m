 irq_set_affinity_and_hint

The driver uses irq_set_affinity_hint() to update the affinity_hint mask
that is consumed by the userspace to distribute the interrupts and to apply
the provided mask as the affinity for its interrupts. However,
irq_set_affinity_hint() applying the provided cpumask as an affinity for
the interrupt is an undocumented side effect.

To remove this side effect irq_set_affinity_hint() has been marked
as deprecated and new interfaces have been introduced. Hence, replace the
irq_set_affinity_hint() with the new interface irq_set_affinity_and_hint()
where the provided mask needs to be applied as the affinity and
affinity_hint pointer needs to be set and replace with
irq_update_affinity_hint() where only affinity_hint needs to be updated.
