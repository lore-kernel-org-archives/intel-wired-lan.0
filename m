This change makes it so that we use the length of the packet instead of the
DD status bit to determine if a new descriptor is ready to be processed.
The obvious advantage is that it cuts down on reads as we don't really even
need the DD bit if going from a 0 to a non-zero value on size is enough to
inform us that the packet has been completed.
