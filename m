This hunts down several places around packet templates/dummies for
switch rules which are either repetitive, fragile or just not
really readable code.
It's a common need to add new packet templates and to review such
changes as well, try to simplify both with the help of a pair
macros and aliases.

bloat-o-meter is happy about that (built w/ LLVM 13):

RO Data                                      old     new   delta
ice_dummy_pkt_profiles                         -     672    +672

Diffstat also looks nice, and adding new packet templates now takes
less lines.

We'll probably come out with dynamic template crafting in a while,
but for now let's improve what we have currently.

From v2[0]:
 - rebase on top of the GTP changes;
 - new: convert template search code to a rodata array (-1000 bytes
   from .text, -400 bytes from ice.ko);
 - collect Reviewed-by and Tested-by (Marcin, Michal).

From v1[1]:
 - rebase on top of the latest next-queue (to fix #3 not applying);
 - adjust the kdoc accordingly to the function proto changes in #3;
 - no functional changes.

Alexander Lobakin (5):
  ice: switch: add and use u16[] aliases to ice_adv_lkup_elem::{h,m}_u
  ice: switch: unobscurify bitops loop in ice_fill_adv_dummy_packet()
  ice: switch: use a struct to pass packet template params
