> For searching the right DDP package that the PF uses, the DCF needs the DDP
> package characteristic information such as the PF's device serial number
> which is used to find the package loading path, and the exact DDP track ID,
> package name, version.
> 
> Only with the matched DDP package, the DCF can get the right metadata to
