Subject: [Intel-wired-lan] [PATCH v4 3/4] i40e: Limit msix vectors to
 housekeeping CPUs
In-Reply-To: <20200928183529.471328-1-nitesh@redhat.com>

If we have isolated CPUs designated to perform real-time tasks, to keep the
latency overhead to a minimum for real-time CPUs IRQ vectors are moved to
housekeeping CPUs from the userspace. Creating MSIX vectors only based on
the online CPUs could lead to exhaustion of housekeeping CPU IRQ vectors in
such environments.

This patch prevents i40e to create vectors only based on online CPUs by
retrieving the online housekeeping CPUs that are designated to perform
managed IRQ jobs.
