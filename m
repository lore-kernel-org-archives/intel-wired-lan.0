You're getting this performance boost by adding more code in the fast
path for every XDP program; so what's the performance impact of that for
cases where we do run an eBPF program?

Also, this is basically a special-casing of a particular deployment
scenario. Without a way to control RX queue assignment and traffic
steering, you're basically hard-coding a particular app's takeover of
the network interface; I'm not sure that is such a good idea...
