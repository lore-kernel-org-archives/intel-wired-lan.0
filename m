You're assuming burn out or recruitment problems is due to patch workload
or too many "trivial" patches.

In my experience, "other maintainers" is by far the biggest cause of
burn out for my kernel maintenance work.

Certainly arguing with a maintainer about some obviously-correct patch
series must be a good example of this.
