Subject: [Intel-wired-lan] [PATCH] i40e: Add a check to see if MFS is set
Message-ID: <20200407151302.25191-1-todd.fujinaka@intel.com>

A customer was chain-booting to provision his systems and one of the
steps was setting MFS. MFS isn't cleared by normal warm reboots
(clearing requires a GLOBR) and there was no indication of why Jumbo
Frame receives were failing.

Add a warning if MFS is set to anything lower than the default.
