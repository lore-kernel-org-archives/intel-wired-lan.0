Subject: [Intel-wired-lan] [PATCH 7/8] docs: networking: device_drivers:
 replace some characters

List-ID: <intel-wired-lan.osuosl.org>

The conversion tools used during DocBook/LaTeX/html/Markdown->ReST
conversion and some cut-and-pasted text contain some characters that
aren't easily reachable on standard keyboards and/or could cause
troubles when parsed by the documentation build system.

Replace the occurences of the following characters:

	- U+00a0 ('?'): NO-BREAK SPACE
	  as it can cause lines being truncated on PDF output
