Subject: [Intel-wired-lan] [PATCH] igb: mark
	igb_rxnfc_write_vlan_prio_filter() static

We get 1 warning when building kernel with W=1:
drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_ethtool.c:2707:5: warning: no previous prototype for 'igb_rxnfc_write_vlan_prio_filter' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

In fact, this function is only used in the file in which it is
declared and don't need a declaration, but can be made static.
so this patch marks this function with 'static'.
