Took a quick look at the irqbalance repo and saw the following commit:

dcc411e7bf    remove affinity_hint infrastructure

The commit message mentions that "PJ is redesiging how affinity hinting
works in the kernel, the future model will just tell us to ignore an IRQ,
and the kernel will handle placement for us.  As such we can remove the
affinity_hint recognition entirely".

This does indicate that apparently, irqbalance moved away from the usage of
affinity_hint. However, the next question is what was this future model?
I don't know but I can surely look into it if that helps or maybe someone
here already knows about it?

Right, but if they only rely on this API so that the IRQs are spread across
all the CPUs then that issue is already resolved and these other drivers
should not regress because of changing this behavior. Isn't it?
