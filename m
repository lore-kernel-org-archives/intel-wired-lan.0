Subject: [Intel-wired-lan] [PATCH net 07/13] renesas: reject unsupported
 external timestamp flags

From: Jacob Keller <jacob.e.keller@intel.com>

Fix the renesas PTP support to explicitly reject any future flags that
get added to the external timestamp request ioctl.

In order to maintain currently functioning code, this patch accepts all
three current flags. This is because the PTP_RISING_EDGE and
PTP_FALLING_EDGE flags have unclear semantics and each driver seems to
have interpreted them slightly differently.
