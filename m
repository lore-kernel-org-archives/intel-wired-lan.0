Hi Ira!

The APIs should be tweaked to use a symbol (GLOBAL, PER_THREAD), instead of
true/false. Try reading the above and you'll see that it sounds like it's
doing the opposite of what it is ("enable_this(false)" sounds like a clumsy
API design to *disable*, right?). And there is no hint about the scope.

And it *could* be so much more readable like this:

     dev_access_enable(DEV_ACCESS_THIS_THREAD);
