Not sure what you meant by "legacy I/O spaces" on this patch. 
I mean, I would expect non-PCIe devices - like bttv and other
devices developed at the past millennium or so to be "legacy",
but at least on media, it is touching some drivers that aren't
that old, while keeping the really old ones untouched. Instead,
it is touching a driver developed in 2017 plus two other ones
that are a way newer than other drivers.

The support for the Bt8xx chipset, in particular, is really 
weird, as a sound driver for such chipset:

was marked as dependent of LEGACY_PCI, while the DVB and V4L2 ones 
weren't.

Sounds confusing to me, as the PCI bridge used by a Bt87x device 
should be the same for all three subdevices.

I'm confused...
